The website will showcase the hotelâ€™s features, services, rooms, rates, and location
. You will use HTML5 to create the structure and content of the website, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and tables.
You will use CSS3 to style the website and make it responsive, such as changing colors, fonts, layouts, animations and transitions.
You will use JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to the website, such as
validating user input, fetching data from an API, and displaying a map and a booking system.
